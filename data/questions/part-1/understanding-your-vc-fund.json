      "correctAnswers": ["b"],
      "explanation": "Before writing a single line of code, you need to answer: What type of fund am I building for? This isn't academic. The stage focus, investment strategy, and fund structure determine what data you need to track, how complex your workflows need to be, what integrations matter, how much automation is possible, and what your data model should look like. Building generic 'VC software' is a recipe for failure.",

      "explanation": "A typical seed fund might make 5-10 investments per year with check sizes around $500K-$2M. These funds are often run by small teams of 2-5 people. The diligence process is relatively quick (1-3 weeks typically) but still substantive. They're evaluating founder quality, market opportunity, early traction, and whether the company has a real shot at reaching Series A.",

They see moderate deal volume (20-40 companies per fund), write checks in the $2M-$10M range, and have substantial diligence processes. These funds usually take board seats. They reserve 30-50% of their capital for follow-on investments in their best companies. Deal teams are larger here with 5-10 investment professionals.",

      "correctAnswers": ["a", "b", "c", "d"],
      "explanation": "Growth equity funds operate at the other end of the spectrum. Low deal volume (maybe 10-20 companies per fund), very large checks ($25M-$100M+), and diligence processes that can stretch 3-6 months. These deals look more like acquisitions than venture bets. The fund is evaluating mature businesses with real revenue, established customers, and clear unit economics. The focus shifts from 'will this work?' to 'can this scale profitably?'",

      "explanation": "In PE, the questions deal teams ask are often so bespoke that the technologist's role shifts from building systems to being part of the deal team itself. You're using data to help deal teams get to conviction. Can we model the impact of operational improvements? What does the competitive landscape look like quantitatively? Each project is tailored to bespoke needs. This isn't about building one platform that serves all portfolio companies.

      "explanation": "Multi-strategy funds run separate vehicles for different stages: a seed fund, a Series A/B fund, a growth fund. Each vehicle operates with its own strategy, team, and capital base, but under one brand and shared infrastructure. The challenge is managing complexity while maintaining the benefits of integration. Each fund needs its own LP reporting, its own capital tracking, its own performance metrics. But deals, companies, and relationships should be shared.",

      "explanation": "Geographic focus shapes your architecture significantly. Multi-entity structures require careful data modeling: which legal entity made which investment? How do you aggregate performance across entities while maintaining separation for legal and tax purposes? Currency handling affects portfolio valuation and financial reporting. Time zones affect scheduling features, notification timing, and how you display dates.

Tagging and metadata become more important than rigid hierarchies. Signal processing for deal flow requires broader pattern matching: you can't rely on sector-specific signals, so you need systems that surface opportunities based on founder quality, market dynamics, and thesis fit across different industries. Your metric tracking needs to gracefully handle B2B SaaS, consumer apps, marketplaces, and hardware companies in the same portfolio.",

Portfolio management - How often do you interact with portfolio companies? LP reporting - How often do you report to LPs? Pain points - What takes the most time that shouldn't?
