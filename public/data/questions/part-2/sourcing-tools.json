      "explanation": "Sourcing tools don't work equally well for all funds, and understanding when they create value matters more than understanding how to build them. Many early-stage, thesis-driven funds find that companies are too early for datasets and criteria are too specific for effective filtering.",

      "explanation": "Around 2017-2018, funds that invested in sourcing infrastructure got real competitive advantage because the infrastructure didn't exist yet. There were no purpose-built VC sourcing tools. Data providers had limited coverage. If you wanted systematic sourcing, you had to build it yourself. The funds that invested in this infrastructure got ahead and proved the model worked.",
