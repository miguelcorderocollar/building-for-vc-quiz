      "explanation": "Fundraising is how you raise your next fund. After you've invested Fund I and shown results, you need to convince LPs to commit capital to Fund II. This involves identifying potential LPs, preparing materials that demonstrate your track record, managing relationships over months of conversations, and closing commitments.",

Your CRM tracks LP relationships. Sourcing-type tools can help identify potential LPs. Unlike other parts of the VC tech stack, there's no dominant fundraising-specific platform yet.",

You want to identify institutional investors, family offices, high-net-worth individuals, and fund-of-funds that invest in your stage, geography, and strategy. Use the same sourcing tools: PitchBook has good data on institutional investors, Specter can help identify active LPs in your space. If you're interested in specific datasets for LPs, Preqin is more focused on LP data.",
