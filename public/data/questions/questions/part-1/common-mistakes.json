      "correctAnswers": ["b"],
      "explanation": "The first one to three months should be mostly research and observation, not building. You need to understand how the fund actually operates, not how they say they operate in the interview. You need to understand what the real pain points are, what's been tried before and why it failed, and what workflows are essential versus nice-to-have. Spend your first two weeks just observing, shadow each GP, attend partner meetings, watch how deals actually flow.",

      "explanation": "Watch out for these red flag phrases, especially from yourself: 'Let's just start building and iterate.' 'This should be quick to throw together.' 'We can always change it later.' These are all signs you're jumping in too early. By week nine, you should have enough context to propose a real technical strategy. Get buy-in on priorities.

      "correctAnswers": ["c"],
      "explanation": "Commodity functionality should almost always be bought: CRM basics, email tracking, document signing. These are solved problems. Complex compliance requirements like fund administration and LP reporting should definitely be bought unless you have deep expertise. Build when you have true differentiation - novel sourcing strategy or unique thesis requiring custom tooling. Build when you have highly specific workflows that genuinely don't map to existing tools. The key is to have this conversation explicitly, not assume everyone's on the same page.",

      "explanation": "Don't build custom CRMs anymore - you can get most features off the shelf with tools like Affinity or Attio. As a solo engineer or small team, don't spend time building a new one from scratch. The same goes for data scraping - don't waste weeks building LinkedIn scrapers when you can buy data from providers like People Data Labs, Crunchbase, or others. Build on top of purchased data, don't recreate it. Your time as an engineer is the most expensive resource.",

That's a full plate. That's valuable work. Here's what one technical person cannot do: build and maintain a full custom stack from scratch, replace major platforms with custom alternatives, or provide 24/7 support for critical systems.",

      "explanation": "Watch out for red flags: 'We need custom everything' usually means nobody's thought about buy versus build. 'Buying software is expensive' ignores that building is far more expensive when you factor in your time. 'You'll have help... eventually' is code for 'we have no concrete plans to hire.' 'Just get something working, we'll improve it later' is how you accumulate crushing technical debt. Set clear expectations about what you can ship in Q1, what requires buying software, what requires hiring another person.",

      "explanation": "A $100M VC fund's scale looks like this: five to twenty employees, 200 to 500 deals per year in the funnel, 20 to 50 portfolio companies, 20 to 100 LPs, and quarterly reporting (not real-time dashboards). This is not scale. This is a small business. You can run all of this on a single Postgres database, a monolithic application, simple cron jobs, and basic authentication.

No integrations means manual processes everywhere. That's not the answer either. Find the balance your partnership is comfortable with. Maybe you can use foundational model APIs for non-sensitive tasks but not for deal flow analysis. Maybe you can use cloud logging with proper data filtering.
