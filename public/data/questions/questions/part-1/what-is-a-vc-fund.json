      "correctAnswers": ["a"],
      "explanation": "Limited Partners (LPs) are the investors who provide capital to venture capital funds. They have 'limited' involvement, meaning they commit capital but don't make investment decisions or participate in day-to-day operations. Their role is largely passive: they commit money, receive reports, and eventually receive distributions when portfolio companies exit.",

      "correctAnswers": ["b"],
      "explanation": "When an LP commits capital, they don't write a check immediately. Instead, they promise to provide that capital over time as the fund needs it for investments. The money stays in the LP's accounts earning returns until the fund calls for it. This distinction between committed capital and called capital is fundamental to how VC funds operate.",

(2) Carried interest (carry), typically 20% of profits, but only after LPs receive back all their invested capital and sometimes after a preferred return hurdle.

A fund vehicle (like 'Acme Ventures Fund I, LP') is a separate legal entity, usually a limited partnership, that holds LP commitments, makes investments, and distributes returns. A single management company typically manages multiple funds over time. Understanding this separation is essential because money flows differently through these entities.",

For example, if a fund wants to invest $5 million in a company but several LPs want additional exposure, the fund might create an SPV just for that deal, allowing those LPs to invest beyond their fund commitment. Side cars are similar but broader - they're parallel vehicles that invest alongside the main fund across multiple deals.",

      "correctAnswers": ["b"],
      "explanation": "A capital call is a formal notice to LPs saying the fund needs capital for an investment. Each LP must send their pro-rata share within a specified timeframe (often 30 days). For example, if a fund needs $3 million and an LP committed 10% of the fund, they would need to wire $300,000.

      "explanation": "The standard VC distribution waterfall works like this: first, return all the capital that LPs invested. If the fund called $80 million total, the first $80 million of exits goes back to LPs. Then split remaining profits: typically 80% to LPs, 20% to GPs as carry. Some funds (more common in PE) include a preferred return hurdle between these steps, but the basic structure is capital return first, then profit split.",

It's calculated as total cash distributed to LPs divided by total capital called from LPs. For example, if a fund called $80 million and has distributed $120 million, the DPI is 1.5x.

      "explanation": "All three are common misconceptions. VCs don't have a pile of cash - they have LP commitments that get called over time. Not all VC funds work the same way - a seed fund operates nothing like a growth equity fund. Exits don't happen quickly - the average time from investment to exit is 7-10 years, sometimes longer. Understanding these realities is crucial for building the right software.",
