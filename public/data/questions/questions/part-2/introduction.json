      "correctAnswers": ["c"],
      "explanation": "The key principle is to buy commodity functionality (like CRM basics, email tracking, document signing) and build when you have true differentiation. For example, don't build your own CRM - use Attio or Affinity. But if your fund has a novel sourcing strategy or unique thesis that requires custom tooling, that's worth building.",

      "correctAnswers": ["b"],
      "explanation": "Not all venture capital is the same. Building software for a pre-seed fund is fundamentally different than building for a growth equity fund. The stage focus, investment strategy, and fund structure determine what data you need to track, how complex your workflows need to be, and what your data model should look like.",

      "correctAnswers": ["c"],
      "explanation": "The recommended approach is to sequence implementation across three phases: Phase 1 - Learn what your fund needs, Phase 2 - Build the backbone (CRM, fund ops) and quick wins, Phase 3 - Decide on your big swing. Don't try to build everything at once.",

      "explanation": "Before writing any code or buying tools, you need to understand your specific fund's stage, strategy, and workflows. Building generic 'VC software' is a recipe for failure.

      "correctAnswers": ["a", "b", "c", "d"],
      "explanation": "All of these factors determine what technology matters: stage focus (a seed fund operates nothing like a growth equity fund), investment strategy (thesis-driven funds need research infrastructure, network-driven funds need relationship tracking), fund structure (multi-fund structures need different data models), and geographic focus (global funds face different challenges than local ones).",

      "correctAnswers": ["b"],
      "explanation": "The biggest mistake new technical hires make is trying to build everything at once. They see the full landscape of what's possible and want to implement a comprehensive tech stack from day one.
