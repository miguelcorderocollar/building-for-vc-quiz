      "explanation": "Your website and external presence are about first impressions and credibility. They're less about technology and more about branding, design, and content. The technology should be simple and stay out of the way. What matters is that your website clearly communicates what your fund is about, looks professional, and makes it easy for people to understand if you're the right investor for them.",

      "explanation": "Hire design help. Unless you have design expertise on your team, hire a brand agency to design your website. The difference between a professionally designed site and one you design yourself is immediately obvious. Founders and LPs are forming judgments based on these first impressions. Good design communicates professionalism and attention to detail.",

      "explanation": "Use a modern CMS. Choose a content management system that makes it easy to update your website without editing code. You'll get frequent requests to update content: adding new investments, updating team member bios, changing copy, publishing new content. If updating the website requires a developer every time, it becomes a bottleneck.",

      "explanation": "For social media, focus on LinkedIn and X where founders and LPs already are. Individual partners having their own presence on LinkedIn and X often matters more than the fund's official accounts. When partners share their thinking, make introductions, and engage with their networks, it builds the fund's reputation through their personal brands.
