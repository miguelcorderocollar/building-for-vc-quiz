You expect one person to solve all technical problems while you figure out what you actually need. There's no budget for data subscriptions, cloud infrastructure, or tooling beyond salary. Partners aren't willing to invest time in defining problems and giving feedback. Many successful funds operate without dedicated technical staff using off-the-shelf tools.",

      "explanation": "The ideal technical profile: broad software engineering skills, data engineering depth (pipelines, databases, integrations), and VC domain knowledge. Technical skills are learnable. Product sense in a specialized domain like VC is harder to acquire. How much you weight vision-selling versus hands-on execution depends on fund size and team structure.",

Look for someone who has shipped projects end-to-end with minimal supervision. The first tech hire should be able to sell the vision of what's possible with data & tech internally and generate excitement among partners. They need to be self-motivated to identify opportunities and pitch their own projects.",

      "explanation": "The first tech hire should be able to sell the vision of what's possible with data & tech internally and generate excitement among partners. They need to be self-motivated to identify opportunities where data, tech & AI can add value and pitch their own projects. Great tech hires need to be proactive problem-identifiers who can independently scope and drive their own work rather than wait for assignments. This is different from typical banking or consulting analysts who are accustomed to working on urgent, well-scoped deliverables.",

      "explanation": "Don't hire a second person until the first hire has identified clear workstreams to divide. When to hire a second person: you have clear, separable workstreams (e.g., data infrastructure vs. internal tools vs. ML/AI initiatives), the first hire is consistently underwater despite good prioritization, or you've identified a big swing that requires dedicated focus and the first hire can't abandon other responsibilities. The first hire's job isn't just building tools - it's discovering what the fund actually needs.",

      "correctAnswers": ["b"],
      "explanation": "Only hire specialists when there's enough work to keep them occupied long-term. If you want to take a big swing on AI/ML, use the first hire to scope it and build the data infrastructure to support it, then hire someone dedicated to that initiative. For niche specialties with uncertain long-term demand, use consultants for the initial build. Larger funds often do this: bring in external help to ship something, then decide whether the workstream justifies a full-time hire. The pattern is: generalist first to figure out what matters, then specialists for sustained investment in specific areas.",

      "explanation": "On compensation: base salaries are typically in line with tech companies. Carried interest (carry) is still rare for technical hires but becoming more common, especially at senior levels. Equity is non-existent (VC funds don't have equity like startups do). The value proposition is: interesting problems, high autonomy, direct impact, exposure to the startup ecosystem. VC fund technical roles sit awkwardly in the market - you're not a big tech company with standard levels, you're not a startup with equity upside.",

      "explanation": "Watch out for these warning signs: No evidence of independent ownership - ask about projects they drove end-to-end. If every example involves working within a well-defined scope set by someone else, they'll struggle in a VC environment. Dismissive of 'boring' work - data pipelines, integrations, and internal tools aren't glamorous. If a candidate only wants to work on interesting technical problems, they won't do the unglamorous work that actually matters. Can't explain technical concepts simply - they'll be working with non-technical people every day. If they can't translate technical trade-offs into business terms, they'll struggle to get buy-in for projects.",

Avoid hiring too junior. Let your first hire identify what actually matters before expanding the team. The first technical hire at a VC fund is a unique role: part engineer, part product manager, part internal consultant. Getting it right means finding someone who can operate independently in an ambiguous environment while delivering real value.",
